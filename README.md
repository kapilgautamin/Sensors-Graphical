 Displays a list of sensors in a smartphone

This project picks up all the sensors in a smartphone and uses a list adapter to populate each sensor.

Each sensor has a Start and Pause button which can be use to start / stop the polling of the data from the sensor.

It also has a delay button which can be used to change the frequency at which the data is delivered to the framework from the sensor chip.

The data is plotted using a Graphich visualization library which plots the data for each axis of the sensor.
